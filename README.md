University Chatbot Project

The main goal of the university chatbot is to assist students, teachers, and visitors by providing instant answers and automating administrative tasks.
It acts as a virtual assistant available 24/7 to improve communication within the university.
Students: access to schedules, grades, and university services.

Professors: teaching schedules, class management, and announcements.

Visitors: admission requirements, campus info, and contact details.
